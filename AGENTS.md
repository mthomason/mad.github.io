## Logos

_The logos do not have the rounded corners._

The icons are in the `img` folder.  The number at the end of the icon name is the size of the image.  For instance, the one that ends with 20 is a 20x20 icon.  The one that ends in 72 is 72x72.

## Development Guidelines

- **Indentation**: Use tabs for indentation in all HTML and CSS files.
- **Website Structure**: The website is built with static HTML and CSS. All styles should be centralized in the `css/style.css` file to maintain a consistent design.
- **Verification**: Before submitting changes, perform frontend verification by running a Playwright script to capture screenshots of the updated pages. Ensure the visual appearance is correct.
