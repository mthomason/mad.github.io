# .mad File Extension

## What is a .mad file?

A `.mad` file is a **Mobile Analytics Document** created by the MAD Designer application. MAD Designer is a business intelligence tool for iOS and macOS that allows users to design, view, and share custom reports from their enterprise data.

These files serve as a container for all the elements that make up a mobile analytics report, including:

*   **Data Source Connections**: Details for connecting to databases like MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server.
*   **Query Definitions**: The SQL queries used to fetch the data for the report.
*   **Report Layout**: The visual structure of the report, including charts, tables, text labels, and images.
*   **Formatting Information**: Custom styles and formatting applied to the report elements.

## More Information

The `.mad` file format is designed to be portable. A user can design a report on one device (e.g., a Mac) and share the `.mad` file with another user, who can then open and view the interactive report on a different device (e.g., an iPhone). This makes it easy to distribute and consume business intelligence reports within an organization.

Reports can also be exported from MAD Designer into static formats like PDF for wider distribution to users who may not have the application installed.
