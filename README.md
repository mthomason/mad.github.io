## About MAD Designer

MAD Designer is a powerful mobile business intelligence (BI) tool that empowers users to design, view, and share custom reports directly from their enterprise data sources. Built for professionals who need on-the-go access to their data, it provides a seamless experience for connecting to SQL Server and MySQL databases.

The application consists of three main components:
1.  A **Query Designer** to build ad hoc queries with multiple tables, joins, and filters.
2.  A **Report Designer** to create visually rich reports with data labels, images, and custom formatting.
3.  A **Report Viewer** to interact with the generated reports.

Reports are saved as `.mad` files (Mobile Analytics Document), a self-contained format that bundles the data connection, query, and layout, making them easy to share with other MAD Designer users.

## Key Features

*   **Direct Database Connectivity**: Securely connect to MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server databases.
*   **Powerful Query Builder**: Craft complex SQL queries with an intuitive visual interface.
*   **Rich Report Authoring**: Design professional reports with a variety of formatting and layout options.
*   **Share and Export**: Share interactive `.mad` files with colleagues or export reports as static PDFs for wider distribution.

## Target Audience

MAD Designer is built for:
*   **Business Analysts** who need to transform raw data into actionable insights.
*   **Data Professionals & Developers** who need to quickly test queries and prototype data solutions for end-users.
